## Overview

I have analyzed a Citibike dataset - ridesharing data in Manhattan - and using **Tableau**, performed some analyses using various graphs to find out whether Citibije or another implementation of its idea would be a good business idea in Des Moines, Iowa.

## Results 

* Males tend to ride longer than females at any given ride
* Subscribers tend to ride longer and more frequently than one-time customers
* The most rides and the longest ones occur during the peak hours of 5-7pm on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays

## Summary

* Additional analyses could include:
  - Multiple maps showing the locations of where the beginning and end of each trip was.
    * this will require the stopID and startID tables from the dataset.
  - a location heatmap showing the most likely spots for rides. This will provide a backdrop for a predictive machine learning model to determine a good place to have a location for a bike station.

**In summary**

* It seems like Males are more likely to ride during the weekdays in Manhattan. 
* Since the peak hours for those weekdays are when people usually leave work (5 - 7pm). 
* It would be wise to buiild bike stations near office buildings
* Business should schedule maintenance done on stations and bikes on the weekends in the mornings.
